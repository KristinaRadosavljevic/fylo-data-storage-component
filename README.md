## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS grid
- Animations
- Media queries

### What I learned

This challenge gave me a chance to practice animations (especially using the `transform` property) and absolute positioning of elements within each other, including the use of psedo-elements such as `::after`.

### Continued development

Pseudo-elements and transformations are a rich source of inspiration when it comes to implementing animations in a project, so in a future challenge I would like to push mysefl even further to get more practice in this area.
